I want the site to be useful to owners of companies and helped them to sell their goods. There are many websites and even if I do like the larger competitors that still will not be different. What can this do to jump head and shoulders above the competition? What are your ideas on the development of the functional site? If you have time, then help me. By the way, I love criticism, so that criticism of my project.
